    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This broccoli pesto recipe offers up a delicious solutionâ€”broccoli florets that are whizzed right into the pesto sauce itself, adding an even more vibrant punch of emerald green to the sauce as well as a serious nutritional boost. In addition to being a great source of fiber, this dark green member of the brassica family boasts lots of vitamin C and vitamin A, as well as some iron, calcium and potassium. Blended into a classic pesto along with some of the pasta cooking water, broccoli gives this pesto sauce just a bit of creaminess and a lot more oomph.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1lb
            <b>cooked pasta of your choice, pasta water reserved</b></li>
        <li>4 cups<b> broccoli florets</b></li>
        <li>2 cups <b> basil leaves, lightly packed</b></li>
        <li>2 <b>garlilc cloves</b></li>
        <li>1/4 cup <b>pine nuts</b></li> 
        <li>1 cup<b>extra virgin olive oil</b></li>
        <li>1/2 tsp <b>salt</b></li>
        <li>1 cup <b>Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot bring water to a rapid boil. <em>It is important to salt your water before adding the broccoli and pasta. Do this to your own taste.</em></li>
        <li>Add the broccoli, bring the water back up to a boil for two minutes. Do not drain the water! Immediately transfer broccoli (with a slotted spoon) to a colander place under cold running water to stop further cooking.</li>
        <li>Bring the water back to a boil and add your favorite pasta and cook according to the package (reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining).</li>
        <li>In a large blender or food processor, blend together broccoli, basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, salt and Parmigiano-Reggiano until smooth. Slowly pour in 1 cup of reserved pasta water until a nice sauce is formed. If sauce is too thick, add more pasta water one tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Toss hot pasta with sauce until completely coated. Top with extra Parmesan, pine nuts and chili flakes if desired. Enjoy!</li>
